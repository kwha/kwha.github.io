    <h1>The <i>Lucky David Deutsch</i></h1>
    <p>
      David Deutsch woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside his window in Oxford. He stretched and sat up in bed, feeling the warmth of the sun on his face. He reached for his phone and checked the time - it was already past eight o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      David groggily got out of bed and made his way to the kitchen. He put the kettle on and searched through the cupboards for his favorite mug. As he waited for the water to boil, he thought of doing something different today. Out of all the versions of himself, surely there must be one that is the luckiest of them all. But, chances are that, whomever <i>He</i> is, <i>He</i> doesn't have a clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even though there aren't any means of communication, there is a clever way in which he can force the luck upon <i>Him</i>, forever changing <i>His</i> life.
    </p>
    <p>
      David opened his Quantum Computing Interface, then quickly setup a single qubit followed by a measurement and started running the experiment, exactly 96 times. As he gathered his output data and converted the bits to string, he looked at the gibberish text with a smile on his face, for he new that other <i>He</i> is looking at 01001101 01010111 01001001 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01110010 01100101 01100001 01101100 00101110 converted to "MWI is real.".
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>He</i> wanted then to put <i>His</i> luck to the test, gathering the output for the next National Lottery numbers, and by no small surprise <i>He</i> won. <i>He</i> then started writing <i>His</i> next book, completely extracted from this magic random binary generator, explaining all of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I finish this text, I cannot stop feeling at odds with such reality, for I may as well try the above experiment and <i>I</i> will read "MWI is not real. This is God talking."
